  "FOOTER_DESC": "The Gaza Orphans Foundation website facilitates the necessary arrangements between orphans and sponsors based on priority. Our site contains a large number of files for orphans affected by the genocide in Gaza. To maintain the orphans' privacy, only surface-level information about the child being considered for sponsorship is displayed. After the sponsorship process is completed, the sponsor can access all the child's files and official documents. If the sponsor wishes to support multiple children, they will first receive information about a portion of them to begin the sponsorship process, and later be provided with information about the remaining children."
